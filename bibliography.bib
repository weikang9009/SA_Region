@article{Arbia2016,
	abstract = {Spatial data are often contaminated with a series of imperfections that reduce their quality and can dramatically distort the inferential conclusions based on spatial econometric modeling. A ``clean'' ideal situation considered in standard spatial econometrics textbooks is when we fit Cliff-Ord-type models to data where the spatial units constitute the full population, there are no missing data, and there is no uncertainty on the spatial observations that are free from measurement and locational errors. Unfortunately in practical cases the reality is often very different and the datasets contain all sorts of imperfections: They are often based on a sample drawn from the whole population, some data are missing and they almost invariably contain both attribute and locational errors. This is a situation of ``dirty'' spatial econometric modeling. Through a series of Monte Carlo experiments, this paper considers the effects on spatial econometric model estimation and hypothesis testing of two specific sources of dirt, namely missing data and locational errors.},

abstract = {Tobler’s first law of geography is widely recognized as reflecting broad empirical realities in geography. Its key concepts of “near” and “related” are intuitive in a univariate setting. However, when moving to the joint consideration of spatial patterns among multiple variables, the combination of attribute similarity and geographical similarity that underlies the concept of spatial autocorrelation is much harder to deal with. This article uses the notion of distance in multiattribute space to explore and visualize the connection between “near” and “related” in a multivariate context. We approach this from a global, local, and regional perspective. We outline a number of ways to combine different visualization techniques and introduce a new local neighbor match test for multivariate local clusters. We illustrate the methods by means of Guerry’s classic data set on moral statistics in 1833 France.},

Written in Python, the library has a long history of supporting novel scholarship and broadening methodological impacts far afield of academic work. Recently, many new techniques, methods of analyses, and development modes have been implemented, making the library much larger and more encompassing than that previously discussed in the literature. As such, we provide an introduction to the library as it stands now, as well as the scientific and conceptual underpinnings of its core set of components. Finally, we provide a prospective look at the library's future evolution.},

@article{Bivand2022,
	abstract = {The count of open source software packages hosted by the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) using key spatial data handling packages has now passed 1,000. Providing a comprehensive review of these packages is beyond the scope of an article. Consequently, this review takes the form of a comparative case study, reproducing some of the approach and workflow of a spatial analysis of a data set including almost all the census tracts in the coterminous United States. The case study moves from visualization and the construction of a spatial weights matrix, to exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial regression. For comparison, implementations of the same steps in PySAL and GeoDa are interwoven, and points of convergence and divergence noted and discussed. Conclusions are drawn about the usefulness of open source software, the significance of sharing contributions both in software implementation but also more broadly in reproducible research, and in opportunities for exchanging ideas and solutions with other research domains.},

	abstract = {Since its introduction more than 15 years ago, the GeoDa software for the exploration of spatial data has transitioned from a closed source Windows-only solution to an open source and cross-platform product that takes on the look and feel of the native operating system. This article reports on the evolution in the functionality and architecture of the software and pays particular attention to its new implementation as a library, libgeoda. This library, through a clearly structured API, can be integrated into other software environments, such as R (rgeoda) and Python (pygeoda). This integration is illustrated with two small empirical examples, investigating local clusters in a historical London cholera data set and among socioeconomic determinants of health in Chicago. A timing experiment demonstrates the competitive performance of GeoDa desktop, libgeoda (C++), rgeoda and pygeoda compared to established solutions in R spdep and Python PySAL, evaluating conditional permutation inference for the Local Moran statistic.},

@article{Benjamini2001,
	abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

	abstract = {As spatial statistics are essential to the geographical inquiry, accessible and flexible software offering relevant functionalities is highly desired. Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) represents an endeavor towards this end. It is an open-source python library and ecosystem hosting a wide array of spatial statistical and visualization methods. Since its first public release in 2010, PySAL has been applied to address various research questions, used as teaching materials for pedagogical purposes in regular classes and conference workshops serving a wide audience, and integrated into general GIS software such as ArcGIS and QGIS. This entry first gives an overview of the history and new development with PySAL. This is followed by a discussion of PySAL's new hierarchical structure, and two different modes of accessing PySAL's functionalities to perform various spatial statistical tasks, including exploratory spatial data analysis, spatial regression, and geovisualization. Next, a discussion is provided on how to find and utilize useful materials for studying and using spatial statistical functions from PySAL and how to get involved with the PySAL community as a user and prospective developer. The entry ends with a brief discussion of future development with PySAL.},
